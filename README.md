<!-- Long description -->
This site is meant to be a place to add and share my works about the things I learn and what I'm interested in. It was built from the [Gatsby's default starter](https://github.com/gatsbyjs/gatsby-starter-default) 

<!-- Technologies -->
## Built With these Technologies

- **[Gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/):** React-based open source framework for creating websites and apps.
- **[React](https://reactjs.org/):** Javascript library for building User Interfaces.
- **[TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/):** Microsoft's open-source Type-safe language that compiles to JavaScript.
- **[Styled-Components](https://styled-components.com):** CSS in JS Library for the styles.
- **[GraphQL](https://graphql.org/):** The query language used to access the data with Gatsby.
- **[Commitlint](https://github.com/conventional-changelog/commitlint):** To enforce [conventional commit format](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/).
- **[ESlint](https://eslint.org/):** To find and fix problems in your JavaScript code. Although [Prettier](https://prettier.io/) was used to format files now the linter `fix` option does it.
- **[GitHub Actions](https://github.com/features/actions):** GitHub's Continuous Integration & Delivery tool.
- **[Renovate](https://renovate.whitesourcesoftware.com/):** Free, open-source app to automate the update of dependencies.
- **[GitHub Issues and Pull Requests Templates](https://docs.github.com/en/github/building-a-strong-community/about-issue-and-pull-request-templates):** Templates to submit new Issues and Pull Requests.

<!-- Project Setup -->
## Setup the project

<!-- Available Scripts -->
## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm run develop`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:8000](http://localhost:8000) to view it in the browser.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production. The build is minified and 
the filenames include the hashes.<br />
The app is ready to be deployed!

### `npm run deploy`

Builds the app for production and deploys it to [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/) <br />
Have a look at [How Gatsby Works with GitHub Pagesw to configure it](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/docs/how-gatsby-works-with-github-pages/).

### `npm run lint` & `npm run lint:fix`

Run ESLint on the project to report wrong patterns on the code, and the second one also tries to fix them
