In the last few years, I have been improving the way I organize myself to get things done. It started with a humble to-do list, and now I have reached a point where the method is complex enough that I spend too much time explaining it to others when they ask me about it. Hence, the reason I am writing this article. 

Any system is good enough if you manage to get things done with it. All the same time, everything can be improved. This is the method I use, which I hope will help you to be more productive.

I added some diagrams along the lecture to understand it better. There is a cheat sheet including all of them in the resources section.
