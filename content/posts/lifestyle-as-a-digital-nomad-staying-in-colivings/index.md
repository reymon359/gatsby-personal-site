Here I will share my experiences living as a digital nomad while staying mostly in Colivings. After being asked multiple times about the topic, the aim of this lecture is to help other people have a better idea of this lifestyle.

I will explain first the concept behind _Digital Nomad_ and _Coliving._ Adding my point of view and experiences. In the end, I will share several **conclusions** and **useful resources.**

## Digital nomad

In a very simple way, a digital nomad is someone that works via the internet, and therefore, they can work remotely from any place with a proper connection. 

Actually, this definition from Wikipedia is quite accurate:

> Digital nomads are people who use telecommunications technologies to earn a living and conduct their life in a nomadic manner. Such workers often work remotely from foreign countries, coffee shops, public libraries, co-working spaces, or recreational vehicles. The most common types of digital nomads include retired or semi-retired persons, independently wealthy or entrepreneurs, and (often younger) remote workers. People typically become digital nomads for many reasons, including the quest for financial independence and a career that allows for location independence. - [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_nomad)

Although most people I met had a laptop (or similar) to work with, this doesn’t mean all of them were doing a job associated with web development, digital marketing, or similar. Some had other jobs and used a computer to get tasks done like filling reports, sending files, or attending meetings.

Others didn't even have a job, like students who attended online classes and completed their homework.

Besides, I met people without a computer, doing independent location jobs such as cookers, volunteers, yoga teachers, etc. I guess they would be out of the digital nomad category if we go strict with the term “digital nomad”. However, I wanted to raise awareness about the multiple ways for achieving location independence without having a remote digital work.

### Why did I decide to embrace this lifestyle?

I have always considered myself an adventurous person. I wanted to explore, live new experiences, see new places, meet new people, eat new foods, and enrich my life in general. With a remote job and nothing that tied me anywhere at the moment, I made a decision and left in search of adventures.

When I moved away to work remotely from a different place, the truth is that I didn’t even know the term “digital nomad”. It was only when I met other people living that way when I got introduced to it. 

And it wasn’t until months later that I realized I was becoming myself one. 

It was just a personal experiment at the beginning.

### My opinion and what I learned from it

Time has passed, and now I have a better idea of this lifestyle. Fortunately, I have found most of the things I was looking for, plus extra experiences and situations I would not have imagined.

**Location independence**

I have ended up with this feeling of “not having a home and my home is anywhere at the same time.”

Looking at a map and thinking, “I could be living there next week”  gives me a rush of freedom, which I love. However, the uncertainty of not knowing where you will be in the future can be stressful for certain people.

**Traveling**

Being faced with the fact of traveling with just a backpack and a small suitcase taught me to realize what is important in my life and what I really need to live it. Embracing minimalism and reducing one’s possessions helped me to achieve this and experience more freedom.

Although this lifestyle offers almost unlimited flexibility, most people may end up in burnout with the lack of stability from constantly traveling which includes booking planes, requesting visas, and searching for accommodations, among others. They will probably go “back to normal” if not finding a way to deal with it, such as _slow traveling._

As an organized person, I myself suffered from this. In the end, I learned to let things flow and to not overplan. Staying longer in the locations and decreasing the travel frequency also helps with the burnout mentioned above. Plus, the longer you stay, the deeper you go into the culture. When people just have a few weeks to visit a place, they tend to go to the main attractions because they don’t want to miss them. They spend most of the time surrounded by tourists in tourist spots and not living with locals as one of them.

However, maybe you don’t have this kind of issue and prefer to travel more frequently. And if you are not sure, you can just try it and learn from it.

**Relationships**

Meeting and learning from new international people while living experiences with them may be one of the best parts of this lifestyle. 

Surprisingly, even though you meet a lot of people, there is a high chance to experience loneliness. It is hard to build strong relationships with other people that don’t stay longer in your location. However, when people stay longer at your place, it becomes pretty easier if you do things like coliving and sharing experiences together. The harder part becomes to maintain those relationships when you separate.

You may get tired of meeting new people that you may not see again in your life or even the next week. This is another reason people end up staying longer in a location, so the connections you make last longer.

Keep in mind these relationships properties vary from the kind of relationship; friendship, romantic, work-related, etc.

**Conclusion**

In my opinion, weighing the pros and cons, the experiences and personal growth you get from this lifestyle are worth the downsides.
