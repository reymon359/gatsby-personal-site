Here I will share my experiences living as a digital nomad while staying mostly in Colivings. After being asked multiple times about the topic, the aim of this lecture is to help other people have a better idea of this lifestyle.

I will explain first the concept behind _Digital Nomad_ and _Coliving._ Adding my point of view and experiences. In the end, I will share several **conclusions** and **useful resources.**

## Digital nomad

In a very simple way, a digital nomad is someone that works via the internet, and therefore, they can work remotely from any place with a proper connection. 

Actually, this definition from Wikipedia is quite accurate:

> Digital nomads are people who use telecommunications technologies to earn a living and conduct their life in a nomadic manner. Such workers often work remotely from foreign countries, coffee shops, public libraries, co-working spaces, or recreational vehicles. The most common types of digital nomads include retired or semi-retired persons, independently wealthy or entrepreneurs, and (often younger) remote workers. People typically become digital nomads for many reasons, including the quest for financial independence and a career that allows for location independence. - [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_nomad)

Although most people I met had a laptop (or similar) to work with, this doesn’t mean all of them were doing a job associated with web development, digital marketing, or similar. Some had other jobs and used a computer to get tasks done like filling reports, sending files, or attending meetings.

Others didn't even have a job, like students who attended online classes and completed their homework.

Besides, I met people without a computer, doing independent location jobs such as cookers, volunteers, yoga teachers, etc. I guess they would be out of the digital nomad category if we go strict with the term “digital nomad”. However, I wanted to raise awareness about the multiple ways for achieving location independence without having a remote digital work.

### Why did I decide to embrace this lifestyle?

I have always considered myself an adventurous person. I wanted to explore, live new experiences, see new places, meet new people, eat new foods, and enrich my life in general. With a remote job and nothing that tied me anywhere at the moment, I made a decision and left in search of adventures.
